**We’ve reworked the schema viewer in the SQL console ⚙️**
<br/>
<br/>
The schema now lives in the right panel, giving you everything you need to explore your database structure quickly.
You can expand specific tables or all at once, and hide the ones you don't need.
Row counts, nullability, and default values are shown based on your settings.
We've spent quite some time making it adaptable to different panel sizes – hope you like it!
